# We're In Danger Of Losing Essential Public Data Forever!

In early 2025, the Trump administration instituded a series of policies that lead various federal agenencies purging public data on various topics including, DEI, the environment, FEMA, and others. The implicatopns of this purge are numerous and troubling. Many businesses and individuals rely on the availability of these data in order to make informed decisions and even if that were not the case, these data are, in a way, the American people - this is our story, our history, the collection and mantenence was paid for by us and it belongs to us. We cannot accept its cencorship. As I write this in February of 2025, these is still time to preserve some of what is disappearing, that that's what I hope to do here.

I am not an expert in anything, I will not understand the vast majority of what ends up here, and I don't intend to change that. I'm just hoping to be a librarian. Eventually, I hope to get things orginized into a hosted database with a publicly accessable front end, but that will take time and now the focus needs to be on collection while that's still possible.

My ask is that if you have any public federal data that you think may be targeted, submit a PR. If you don't already have the data, but know where to get it, export it and submit a PR. If you don't have the time or will to collect the data yourself, send me a DM with where it can be found and I'll collect it myself.

A few notes:
- If you collect data, save it yourself in addition to here. Have it backed up at least 3 times in different physical locations (consider a non-US host)
- Please only submit PUBLIC data. I'm not trying to start Wikileaks 2.0 here.
- If possible, please submit in CSV format or actual database tables. This will make it much easier to orginize later
- I'm requireing pull requests only to guard from trolls and bad actors. I will merge anything that isn't obviously fake
- I'm not aware of other efforts around this right now, but if you are, please let me know. We're better working together, and assuming they're further along, I'll gladly change tactics and support that effort rather than maintaining a different one.
